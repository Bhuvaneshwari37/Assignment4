This project focuses on building a restaurant recommendation system using Python and Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to help users discover top-rated restaurants based on preferences such as city, cuisine, rating, and cost through an interactive Streamlit application.

### Project Overview

* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand restaurant trends across different cities.
* Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values and removing duplicates.
* Applied One-Hot Encoding to categorical features such as city and cuisine.
* Built a recommendation engine using similarity-based or clustering methods.
* Developed a Streamlit web application to display restaurant recommendations.

### Key Features

* City-based restaurant filtering
* Location-wise restaurant exploration within cities
* Display of top-rated restaurants
* Interactive and user-friendly Streamlit interface

### Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* One-Hot Encoding
* K-Means / Cosine Similarity
* Streamlit
* Pickle (for encoder serialization)

### Outcome

* Cleaned and structured restaurant dataset
* Encoded numerical dataset for machine learning
* Functional recommendation system
* Streamlit application showcasing city-wise and top-rated restaurants

This project demonstrates practical experience in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, machine learning-based recommendations, and deployment using Streamlit.
